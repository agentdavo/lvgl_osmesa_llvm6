# DirectX 8 to OpenGL Translation Layer Debugging

## Objective
Fix rendering issues in the dx8gl library where DirectX 8 API calls are not producing visible output despite correct OpenGL draw calls.

## Context / Constraints
- dx8gl library translates DirectX 8.1 to OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile
- Using OSMesa for software rendering with LLVM's llvmpipe
- OpenGL 4.5 Core Profile context is created (requires VAO)
- LVGL integration for GUI display
- Row-major (DirectX) to column-major (OpenGL) matrix conversion required

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Matrix transformation incompatibility between DirectX and OpenGL
  - Mitigation: Use GL_TRUE for transpose parameter in glUniformMatrix4fv
- Risk: Vertex attribute binding issues with OpenGL Core Profile
  - Mitigation: Proper VAO management and attribute location verification
- Risk: Missing viewport configuration
  - Mitigation: Explicit viewport setup after device creation

## Design Overview
The dx8gl library implements a command buffer pattern where DirectX 8 calls are recorded and executed during EndScene/Present. The pipeline consists of:
1. DirectX 8 API calls → Command buffer
2. Command buffer execution → OpenGL state changes and draw calls
3. OSMesa rendering → Framebuffer
4. Framebuffer → LVGL canvas display

## Data / Types
- D3DMATRIX: Row-major 4x4 matrix (DirectX format)
- glm::mat4: Column-major 4x4 matrix (OpenGL format)
- Command buffer: Polymorphic command objects with execute() methods
- VAO cache: Maps FVF+program+VBO to vertex array objects

## Algorithm / Flow
1. Application calls DirectX 8 APIs
2. Commands are queued in command buffer
3. EndScene/Present flushes command buffer
4. Command execution:
   - Apply render states
   - Generate/bind shaders based on fixed-function state
   - Set uniforms (matrices with transpose)
   - Bind VAO and draw
5. OSMesa renders to framebuffer
6. Framebuffer contents displayed in LVGL

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Simple triangle renders correctly through dx8gl
- [ ] Matrix transformations work properly (world/view/projection)
- [ ] Colors are passed correctly from vertices to fragments
- [ ] Spinning cube demo renders properly
- [ ] No OpenGL errors during rendering

## Test Strategy Matrix
| Test Case | Input | Expected Output | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|---------|
| gl_triangle_test | Pure OpenGL triangle | Visible colored triangle | ✓ PASS |
| lvgl_osmesa | Fixed-function OpenGL | Spinning triangle | ✓ PASS |
| dx8_single_frame | DirectX 8 triangle | Visible colored triangle | ✗ FAIL |
| dx8_cube | DirectX 8 cube | Spinning colored cube | ✗ FAIL |

## Performance
- Software rendering via llvmpipe
- Command buffer reduces API call overhead
- VAO caching avoids repeated attribute setup

## Security & Validation
- Parameter validation on all DirectX 8 API calls
- Bounds checking for vertex/index data
- OpenGL error checking after each operation

## Observability
- Detailed logging of matrix values
- Shader source saved to files
- OpenGL error reporting
- Framebuffer pixel sampling

## Rollout / Migration
N/A - Bug fix only

## Documentation Updates
- Update CLAUDE.md with debugging findings
- Document matrix transpose requirement

## Open Questions
1. Why are vertices not appearing despite correct draw calls?
2. Is the vertex data being uploaded correctly to the VBO?
3. Are the attribute locations being bound properly?
