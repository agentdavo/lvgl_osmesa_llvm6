# DirectX 8 to OpenGL Translation Layer Debugging

## Objective
Fix rendering issues in the dx8gl library where DirectX 8 API calls are not producing visible output despite correct OpenGL draw calls.

## Context / Constraints
- dx8gl library translates DirectX 8.1 to OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile
- Using OSMesa for software rendering with LLVM's llvmpipe
- OpenGL 4.5 Core Profile context is created (requires VAO)
- LVGL integration for GUI display
- Row-major (DirectX) to column-major (OpenGL) matrix conversion required

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Matrix transformation incompatibility between DirectX and OpenGL
  - Mitigation: Use GL_TRUE for transpose parameter in glUniformMatrix4fv
- Risk: Vertex attribute binding issues with OpenGL Core Profile
  - Mitigation: Proper VAO management and attribute location verification
- Risk: Missing viewport configuration
  - Mitigation: Explicit viewport setup after device creation

## Design Overview
The dx8gl library implements a command buffer pattern where DirectX 8 calls are recorded and executed during EndScene/Present. The pipeline consists of:
1. DirectX 8 API calls → Command buffer
2. Command buffer execution → OpenGL state changes and draw calls
3. OSMesa rendering → Framebuffer
4. Framebuffer → LVGL canvas display

## Data / Types
- D3DMATRIX: Row-major 4x4 matrix (DirectX format)
- glm::mat4: Column-major 4x4 matrix (OpenGL format)
- Command buffer: Polymorphic command objects with execute() methods
- VAO cache: Maps FVF+program+VBO to vertex array objects

## Algorithm / Flow
1. Application calls DirectX 8 APIs
2. Commands are queued in command buffer
3. EndScene/Present flushes command buffer
4. Command execution:
   - Apply render states
   - Generate/bind shaders based on fixed-function state
   - Set uniforms (matrices with transpose)
   - Bind VAO and draw
5. OSMesa renders to framebuffer
6. Framebuffer contents displayed in LVGL

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Simple triangle renders correctly through dx8gl ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Matrix transformations work properly (world/view/projection) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Colors are passed correctly from vertices to fragments ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Spinning cube demo renders properly ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] No OpenGL errors during rendering ✅ COMPLETED

## Test Strategy Matrix
| Test Case | Input | Expected Output | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|---------|
| gl_triangle_test | Pure OpenGL triangle | Visible colored triangle | ✓ PASS |
| lvgl_osmesa | Fixed-function OpenGL | Spinning triangle | ✓ PASS |
| dx8_single_frame | DirectX 8 triangle | Visible colored triangle | ✓ PASS |
| dx8_cube | DirectX 8 cube | Spinning colored cube | ✓ PASS |
| dx8_ndc_test | DirectX 8 NDC triangle | Colored triangle | ✓ PASS |
| dx8_cube_textured | DirectX 8 cube + floor | Textured floor + cube | ✓ PASS |

## Performance
- Software rendering via llvmpipe
- Command buffer reduces API call overhead
- VAO caching avoids repeated attribute setup

## Security & Validation
- Parameter validation on all DirectX 8 API calls
- Bounds checking for vertex/index data
- OpenGL error checking after each operation

## Observability
- Detailed logging of matrix values
- Shader source saved to files
- OpenGL error reporting
- Framebuffer pixel sampling

## Rollout / Migration
N/A - Bug fix only

## Documentation Updates
- Update CLAUDE.md with debugging findings
- Document matrix transpose requirement

## Open Questions
1. ~~Why are vertices not appearing despite correct draw calls?~~ ✅ RESOLVED - Matrix transpose issue
2. ~~Is the vertex data being uploaded correctly to the VBO?~~ ✅ RESOLVED - Data was correct
3. ~~Are the attribute locations being bound properly?~~ ✅ RESOLVED - VAO binding fixed

## Current Issues
1. Mesa llvmpipe crash during depth buffer clear on frame 2
2. HUD font texture loading not implemented
3. Shader support temporarily disabled due to crashes
